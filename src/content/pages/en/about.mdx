# About## About SiteHubSiteHub is based on a strong vision to provide customers with construction sites that are safe, efficient and more sustainable.

We take responsibility for the combined site logistics and site operations with experienced experts and software and hardware that integrate existing technology with simple processes. For us, it’s important to meet our customers where they are now and help them transition to a more efficient, cleaner and industrially driven way of running site logistics and operations, thereby increasing productivity and reducing material waste.

SiteHub is based on collected data and experience from thousands of handled deliveries, some of the most logistically complex construction sites in Denmark, and in-depth feedback from clients, suppliers and contractors.Since the beginning in January 2021, SiteHub has participated in a number of major construction projects. At the same time, we have invested heavily in the development of our software platform that supports our work on construction sites and ensures data collection and reporting.

In general, we have experience with complicated projects that present logistical challenges such as limited square metres, restricted access, high security measures, many contractors and, not least, a tight project execution schedule. We specialise in larger projects that require traceability, strong logistics and a measurable effort to support the client’s requirements in terms of CO2, sustainability, etc.

We focus our efforts on the construction phase, but we also step in early on to advise the client on logistics and data collection and provide input on how tender texts can be shaped to reflect the client’s needs. And we plan and establish the construction site for a number of our customers. During the actual construction, we take responsibility for the flow of materials in and out of the site so that the builders don’t have to spend time on it and all data is collected.## SiteHub serviсesBased on our experience from the diverse projects we are working and have worked on, we professionalise and systematise all the tasks and challenges that are typically solved ad hoc. We do this with an organisation and structure that ensures progress and resolves conflicts.[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/services/)## OrganisationExecutive team### Ulrik Branner

Technology## Ambition, mission & DNAThe ambitionYou are looking at our ambition. It has been written to put into words what we want to be, and so that you can imagine how you see yourself with us. Our ambition is not concrete, measurable or has a deadline. If we succeed in this, then the ambition shapes the framework for our innovation and efforts, and through that shapes the journey we have chosen to embark on. 

The ambition is about the small circle – all of us at SiteHub. People who have very different lives and backgrounds, people who work together every day. And it’s about the big circle – the fact that we all also have more important things in life than work – family, friends, leisure interests or something else. 

Part of the ambition is to create meaning with the time we spend in the small circle – meaning that our work must provide meaning, make a difference and provide nourishment to the large circle. 

The ambition is rooted in our vision to, via technology and teams, create a better construction industry with professional logistics and site management. And a vision of a significantly more sustainable industry.The missionSiteHub handles the entire process for materials and waste – and documents the material’s journey from cradle to cradle on the construction site SiteHub takes its origin in a strong vision to provide customers with construction sites that are safe, sustainable and efficient. 

We take responsibility for the combined construction site logistics and operation of the construction site via experienced experts, as well as software that integrates existing technology with simple processes. To us, it is important to meet customers where they are now and help them transition to a more efficient, cleaner and industrially driven method of running logistics on the construction site, as well as operations, thereby increasing productivity and reducing material waste. 

SiteHub is based on collected data and experience from thousands of handled deliveries on some of the most logistically complicated sites in Denmark, as well as in-depth feedback from both craftsmen, suppliers and contractors.Our DNA-   COURAGE
-   EFFORT
-   THE TEAM
-   THE CUSTOMER

We believe that despite all our differences, both individually and as a group we share the common DNA that drives our ambition. It is important to emphasize that we cannot all have the same amount of ambition, vision and values, but we recognize them in all of us.

When each day, we go home to our families, we can see that today was a little better than yesterday for the construction industry, and we can step out into the big circle with stronger presence and renewed energy.

In short – our ambition is that, by gathering the right people around our vision and shared values, we can help push our industry in a better direction, while at the same time having a balanced working life.
