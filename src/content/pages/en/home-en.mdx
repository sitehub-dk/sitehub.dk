# EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION SITE LOGISTICS AND OPERATIONS-   Increase safety
-   Shorten time-to-market
-   Support compliance## The construction client’s progress painOf all materials are wasted when you build

5- 0 %Is how many times materials are moved around site on average 

0 xOf all waste in Denmark is construction waste

0 %Of a construction worker’s time is spent handling materials before they build

0 %## SiteHub helps solve these challenges by providing site logistics and operations that free up worker time, minimise waste, capture data and reduce risk.## Our servicesWe solve the tasks that fall between the project’s contracts and interfaces and act as the ‘client’s man’ on site. At the same time, we help contractors and their workers by solving the tasks that traditionally prevent them from optimising their time on site. This reduces time-to-market.[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/services/)## Our technologyUsing technology consisting of proprietary software and advanced hardware solutions, we collect real-time data on materials, transport, waste, etc. so the client can start certification/reporting while construction is underway. This supports the client’s compliance.[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/technology)## Betterconstruction siteRooted in SiteHub’s ambition to create a better and more sustainable construction industry that is also more comfortable and safe to work in for everyone, we operate with the concept ‘Better Construction Site’.

With Better Construction Site, SiteHub wants to be a catalyst for a necessary fundamental cultural change in the industry, where the client takes on more responsibility, the role of the contractor is reshaped, and investments in productivity are increased.[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/better-construction-site/)## ConsultancySiteHub’s experts can be involved early in the process, even before tendering, so that the texts included in the tender/building project description ensure that the contractor provides the required data in relation to sustainability and documentation, and that the contractor’s role is clarified in relation to the competences and processes they actually need to perform.#### In addition, SiteHub's advisors assist with e.g:-   Construction site design
-   Traffic and flow analyses
-   Texts that should be included in the tender/BSB to ensure that the contractor provides the required data in relation to sustainability and documentation
-   Tender lists
-   3D/4D visualisations
-   ESG/CSRD/DGNB/LCA requirements for data capture and how this is supported[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/consultancy/)## Working at SiteHubSiteHub offers varied and challenging work, either on construction sites in direct contact with e.g. suppliers, carriers, contractors, and customers; at our warehouses, or at the head office – all in a team that emphasises a good culture and close cooperation.
