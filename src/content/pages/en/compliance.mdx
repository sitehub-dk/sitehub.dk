# DATA & COMPLIANCE## DATA & COMPLIANCEIncreasing compliance requirements are being placed on the construction client. The Danish national strategy for sustainable construction covers all new construction, and there are independent required limits for the construction process itself, i.e. transport, waste, electricity, water and heat, and for the materials used. At the same time, the EU taxonomy defines a number of environmental goals, just as **CSRD** provides a framework for companies’ sustainability reporting and the statutory **ESG** reporting that many companies must also provide. 

In addition, many developers choose to sustainability certify their buildings according to **DGNB**, **LEED** or **BREEAM**. 

All this requires the processes on site to be captured, recorded and systematised. SiteHub does this by entering the construction site with centralised logistics management and operations, and with a heavy technology package that ensures that all data is collected for client reporting.We collect and aggregate data for:

-   **Materials** – deliveries, quantities and certificates
-   **Transport** – vehicle types, distances and CO2 consumption
-   **Waste** – quantities per fraction and recycling rates
-   **Energy consumption** – electricity, water, etc.
-   **Environmental factors on site** – CO2, noise, NOx, humidity, temperature, etc.### Environment### Social### Governance## How SiteHub contributes to DGNB certificationSiteHub contributes – directly or indirectly – to obtaining approximately 300 DGNB points. In this way, SiteHub’s processes and activities can help achieve approximately 10 per cent of a total DGNB certification.

For example, SiteHub contributes to DGNB PRO 2.1 by implementing processes for waste minimisation and sorting (up to 35 points under indicator 1). In addition, SiteHub can achieve a circular bonus of 10 points by reducing the amount of waste on site.SiteHub also helps with receiving control and data capture for deliveries, creating an automatic process for continuous quality assurance of building materials (PRO 2.2) and obtaining EPDs from suppliers (TEC 1.8).

SiteHub’s on-site processes and activities can therefore – depending on the opportunities and objectives of the project – contribute directly and indirectly to the following:

-   **PRO 2.1** Site / Construction process
-   **PRO 2.2** Documentation of quality of workmanship
-   **PRO 2.2** Moisture management
-   **ENV 1.1** Life cycle assessment
-   **ENV 1.2** Environmentally hazardous substances
-   **ECO 1.1** Overall economy
-   **TEC 1.6** Dismantling and recycling
-   **TEC 1.8** Documentation with environmental product declarations## How SiteHub contributes to LCA reporting**From 1 July 2025**, a life cycle assessment (LCA) must be carried out for all new buildings and a limit value is set for CO2 emissions from the construction process itself. Data for transport, waste, electricity consumption, etc. must be captured.

SiteHub contributes specifically to LCA with:

-   Registration of the actual materials received
-   Calculation of CO2 emissions from material transport
-   Registration of waste volumes and recycling rates
-   Documentation of material data, including EPDs

In addition, SiteHub’s processes contribute to reducing material waste by optimising waste sorting and maximising recycling, centralised handling of incoming deliveries, and the offer of a local warehouse where materials can be stored until they are actually needed on the construction site.## How SiteHub contributes to LEED certificationSiteHub’s activities on site help support two main criteria in **LEED’s** sustainability certification for new construction, which include Sustainable Sites and Materials & Resources.

-   SiteHub’s registration and management of materials in and out of the site can support recycling or reuse of materials.
-   SiteHub registers the specification of the actual materials delivered, mode of transport, distance travelled and an estimated CO2 consumption based on the emissions of the specified vehicle. The documentation thus includes the ‘real’ transport chain and not generic routes, which is also recommended.
-   SiteHub automatically collects EPDs from material suppliers.
-   SiteHub sorts waste into up to 29 fractions, with maximum recycling and economy in mind, and provides a CO2 accounting for resource management.## How SiteHub contributes to BREEAM certificationThe **BREEAM** assessment includes material consumption and waste management – integration of recycled materials and renewable resources as well as waste management from the construction process. Here, SiteHub contributes with waste management, sorting into up to 29 fractions, helping to maximise recycling and minimise waste.

At the same time, SiteHub registers the specific materials delivered to the construction site and collects **EPDs** via integration with the material suppliers.

All data is made available in clear dashboards, and data can be extracted for further analyses.Examples of SiteHub dashboards
