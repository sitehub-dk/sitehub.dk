# Better construction site## Why Better Construction Site?Construction emits 30% of Denmark’s total CO2 emissions and accounts for 40% of waste. 33% of total material consumption takes place in construction, and at the same time, between 5 and 28% of materials are wasted. Despite a number of initiatives, productivity in construction has barely improved in the last 50 years, and the number of work-related accidents has remained unchanged.

The lack of skilled labour is a major challenge in the industry, which is also unable to attract or develop the right skills. At the same time, there are a number of examples of situations where construction site workers are put to work for which they are not trained or certified. This jeopardises quality and safety, as well as the reputation of the client and contractor. SiteHub wants to help change that.SiteHub believes that the client must take greater responsibility for site operations. The client has a big stake in increasing safety, reducing time-to-market and receiving the data needed for regulatory compliance and certifications.

That also means a different view on risk, contracts and contracting. The role of contractors needs to be redesigned to focus on what they do best, and investment in productivity needs to increase.

Site design and operation is a specialised skill in itself, and with the right combination of upfront phased planning and efficient operation with qualified personnel, there are huge efficiency gains, faster completion and greater safety.[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/consultancy/)## SiteHub believes### THE CLIENT NEEDS TO TAKE ON EVEN MORE RESPONSIBILITY### A DIFFERENT VIEW ON RISK, CONTRACTS AND CONTRACTING### THE ROLE OF THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO BE REDESIGNED### INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY MUST BE INCREASEDSiteHub recently acquired the company Byggepladsfolk.nu, taking direct responsibility for the site operators who perform logistical and operational service tasks on construction sites every day.

SiteHub is launching a system called “SiteHub Verified,” which enables the verification of employees’ permits and certifications. The system also provides a digital overview of the safety-related competencies present on the construction site.

SiteHub has also introduced SiteHub Fire Safety, a combination of technology and specially trained fire guards designed to protect construction processes and sites from fire hazards. Additionally, we are further developing our “Work Permit Office”, which ensures that everyone on the construction site is identified and complies with applicable safety requirements. This is further verified through ongoing inspections of the work being carried out on site.‘Better Construction Site will create greater safety and higher productivity on Danish construction sites – and it is our hope that it will form the basis for the construction industry of the future’#### \- Ulrik Branner, CEO of SiteHub
