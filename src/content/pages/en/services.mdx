# SERVICES## SiteHub serviсes**There is an increasing demand for control of on-site CO2 consumption, material documentation and certificates, better waste management and less waste, data on transport to and from the site, etc. Meeting these demands requires a targeted effort and the right resources, and the result for the client is quickly higher costs and longer construction times.** 

This is where SiteHub steps in with site operations, site logistics and data collection as a separate discipline that reports directly to the client. Supported by a solid technology platform, we establish a safe and efficient construction site and service everyone on site with data, logistics services, clean-up and waste management etc.

This model also allows contractors to focus on their craft instead of spending their time looking for materials, lifting or handling equipment they are not trained for, or cleaning up after themselves, which is rarely prioritised enough.

This makes construction more efficient, reduces carbon footprint, ensures documentation and fulfils the construction process according to the client’s values.of a construction worker’s time is spent handling materials before they build

0 %## Logistics managementOur experienced logistics teams handle goods reception, book resources such as cranes and lifts, and register on-site incidents such as closed access roads etc. Centralising these functions ensures full control of all material deliveries and resources, minimising waste and delays. 

All deliveries are registered on our platform, either manually or via integration with suppliers, and delivery notes are scanned to collect documentation and transport data. With a centralised goods receipt, loss and waste are minimised, freeing up valuable worker time and increasing productivity. 

Dashboards and overviews provide a real-time overview of all incoming and outgoing transports and all booked events. Similar overviews can also be displayed on our digital construction site board.[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/technology/)## Hubs / warehousesSiteHub has a total of 18,000 m2 of storage space in Greater Copenhagen and Odense. Here we can store, pick and handle almost anything, and each project’s materials are stored in separate sections, safe from wind, weather and shrinkage, until the project wants them delivered. The storage facilities also allow for mock-up facilities, pre-fab and even project offices under a secure roof.## Site operationsWith SiteHub’s help, planning the layout of the construction site can be started even before the tender phase[Learn more](https://sitehub.dk/en/consultancy/)SiteHub can also take over responsibility for general site operations:

-   Interior design 
-   Site camp
-   Fencing 
-   Access roads 
-   Security and safety 
-   Guards 
-   Canteen 
-   Drawings 
-   Neighbour communication## Qualified site operatorsSiteHub has its own ‘fleet’ of site operators – employees who have the right qualifications and certificates, who know and comply with requirements for equipment, safety, etc. and who are paid correctly according to applicable collective agreements.

Our site workers carry out the operational tasks of the construction site:

-   Hoisting
-   Waste management
-   Transport of materials on site
-   Flagmen
-   Fire wardens
-   General labour on site
-   Site clean-up
-   Maintenance of access roads

Our site teams are available for hire to projects that want an alternative to temp agencies and other companies that can provide ‘arms and legs’, but not necessarily with the necessary qualifications and good employment conditions.## Waste & recyclingSiteHub designs and operates the construction site’s waste and recycling centre to optimise material recycling and minimise waste.   Our employees sort into no less than 29 fractions on several projects, and through close collaboration and integration with waste transporters, we provide dashboards showing quantities per fraction, recycling rates and CO2 emissions.
