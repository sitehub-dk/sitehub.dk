# Consultancy## SiteHub consultancy servicesWe have successfully started several of the most recent projects by participating in an agreed short-term programme with the consultant team in the design and planning phase. Here we have provided insights into: 

-   Construction site design 
-   Traffic and flow analyses 
-   Texts that should be included in the tender/BSB to ensure that the contractor provides the required data in relation to sustainability and documentation 
-   Tender lists 
-   3D/4D visualisations 
-   ESG/CSRD/DGNB/LCA requirements for data capture and how this is supported## SiteHub's 4D construction project planningSiteHub offers 4D construction project planning by combining scheduling with 3D modelling to visualise the development and physical layout of the construction site – everything from machine routing to the location of materials and facilities such as sheds and fences. This makes it possible to avoid bottlenecks and collision risks on site, resulting in a safer and more efficient workflow and fewer delays. 

4D planning allows you to share a visual, interactive model of the construction site with all parties involved, ensuring that everyone has a common understanding of the project from the start, making it easier to discuss solutions and identify potential challenges early on. 

In our experience, detailed site layout planning in advance of tendering **saves 3-6 months** in the start-up phase and ensures an efficient flow on site.## Financial overviewWe can import unique 3D models, such as specific building elements, enabling accurate quantity take-offs. This provides an early financial overview, for example by calculating quantities of fencing or other materials and specialised resources that are crucial for project planning and budget management.## Global terrain visualisation with satellite dataWe can retrieve generic terrain models for specific locations based on satellite data, creating a solid foundation for planning and visualisation while efficiently integrating other important aspects such as logistics, resource location and time management. For projects that require a higher level of detail or precision, we also offer drone flyovers and scans as an additional service.## Sustainability and safety in focusOur approach is not only about making construction site operations more efficient, but also safer and more sustainable. By optimising logistics and anticipating potential problems before they occur, we create a CO2-reduced construction process that reduces waste and environmental impact. At the same time, the increased visibility and planning results in a safer construction site where risks can be minimised.## Customised solutions for each projectOur 4D planning solution is flexible and can be customised to each specific project. With the ability to import accurate 3D models and create detailed scenarios that support efficient site operations, we can ensure that all phases of site operations are optimally visualised and planned, allowing you to make informed decisions and ensure efficient project execution.
